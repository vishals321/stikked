Stikked is an Open-Source PHP Pastebin, with the aim of keeping a simple and easy to use user interface as well as providing an example application for the CodeIgniter framework which stikked is based upon. (Stikked also uses the [jQuery](http://jquery.com) Javascript Library.)

Stikked allows you to easily share code with anyone you wish. Stikked was created for the following reasons:
  * IRC and Private Chats were spammed.
  * Pastebins were ugly.
  * Pastebins were confusing.
  * Pastebins were messy and not thought through.


Stikked rethought code collaboration, by making it easy to paste code. We offer a TextMate Bundle meaning you can paste to Stikked right from TextMate.

**Version 0.5 also features:**
  * Paste Replies
  * Auto snipurl creation
  * Fluid width pastes
  * Auto copying paste url to clipboard.
  * Paste expiration.
  * Fully standards compliant css and xhtml.
  * Random generating names for anonymous users (It's really useful, I swear).
  * Paste Downloading

**In the future you can expect the following:**
  * An installer
  * Paste embedding
